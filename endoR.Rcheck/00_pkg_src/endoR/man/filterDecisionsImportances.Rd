\title{Filter decisions according to their metrics}
\usage{
filterDecisionsImportances(rules, min_imp = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{rules}{data.frame corresponding to the decisions, with all their metrics.}

\item{min_imp}{minimal relative importance of the decisions that must be kept, the threshold to remove decisions is thus going to take lower values than max(imp)*min_imp.}
}
\value{
The decision ensemble from which decisions with the lowest errors and/or importances have been removed, or are indicated in a column "filt_err"/"filt_imp".
}
\description{
This function filters decisions in a heuristic manner according to their importance and multiplicity.
A relative importance threshold that maximises the average product relative importance * n and the number of decisions to be removed is calculated.
All decisions with a relative importance above that threshold are kept. The argument min_imp is the minimal relative importance of the decisions kept.
