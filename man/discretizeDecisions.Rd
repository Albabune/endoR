\usage{
discretizeDecisions(
  rules,
  data = NULL,
  target,
  K = 2,
  features_ctg = NULL,
  splitV = NULL,
  knames = NULL,
  classPos = NULL,
  in_parallel = FALSE,
  n_cores = detectCores() - 1,
  cluster = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rules}{a data frame with a column "condition".}

\item{data}{data to discretize.}

\item{target}{response variable.}

\item{K}{numeric, number of categories (default: K = 2).}

\item{features_ctg}{vector with variables names or column numbers to discretize. If NULL (default), then all numeric variables are discretized.}

\item{splitV}{instead of running internally discretizeData, one can provide a list with, for each variable to discretize in rules, the thresholds delimiting each new category.}

\item{knames}{optional: character vector of the same length than K, containing the ordered names for categories.}

\item{classPos}{for classification, the positive class.}

\item{in_parallel}{if TRUE, the function is run in parallel.}

\item{n_cores}{if in_parallel = TRUE, and no cluster has been passed: number of cores to use, default is detectCores() - 1.}

\item{cluster}{the cluster to use to run the function in parallel.

 @return Decision ensemble with discretized variables in the condition. Decisions with the same condition are aggregated: their importances are summed, and all other metrics are averaged.

 @export}

\item{data_ctg}{discretized data, if splitV is passed. Necessary to re-compute the metrics (if column 'err' in rules).}

\item{return_data}{if TRUE, discretized data are also returned.}
}
\description{
This function replaces in a decision ensemble the boundaries of numerical features by their corresponding levels when the variable is discretized.
If discretized data are not passed, data are first discretized into K categories based on their quantiles (see discretizeData). 
The error, prediction, importance and multiplicity of decisions are updated after discretization.
