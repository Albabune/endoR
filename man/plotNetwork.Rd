\arguments{
\item{decision_ensemble}{stable decision ensemble: list with edges, nodes, etc.}

\item{path_length}{maximal number of edges between 2 nodes, default = Inf.}

\item{layout}{network layout, default is 'stress' (see ggraph package)}

\item{text_size}{size of node labels.}

\item{hide_isolated_nodes}{logical, default = TRUE (= nodes without any edge are not shown).}

\item{seed}{the seed to use for generating the network.}

\item{colour_x_y}{colour of x = edge or node, and y = low, mid or high (e.g., colour_edge_mid), to use for the colour gradients.}
}
\value{
a ggraph object
}
\description{
Returns a plot of nodes and edges. Plots are created with the ggraph and igraph packages.
