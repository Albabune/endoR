\usage{
getNetwork(
  rules,
  data,
  target,
  classPos = NULL,
  additional_decisions = NULL,
  aggregate_taxa = FALSE,
  taxa = NULL,
  type = "coarse",

}
\arguments{
\item{rules}{the decision ensemble.}

\item{data}{data from which to measure characteristic.}

\item{target}{response variable.}

\item{classPos}{the positive class predicted by decisions.}

\item{in_parallel}{if TRUE, the function is run in parallel.}

\item{n_cores}{if in_parallel = TRUE, and no cluster has been passed: number of cores to use.}

\item{cluster}{the cluster to use to run the function in parallel.}
}
\value{
A list with in the nodes and edges dataframes, the feature and interaction importance and influence; the decision-wise feature and interaction importances and influences are contained in the nodes_agg and edges_agg dataframes.
}
\description{
Takes a decision ensemble and measures the importance and influence of each feature and pair of features to create a network. 
For categorical variables or discretized ones, the importance and influence are calculated per level. See featureImportance to obtain the overall feature importance.
