\title{Prune rules of a decision ensemble}
\usage{
pruneDecisions(
  rules,
  data,
  target,
  classPos = NULL,
  maxDecay = 0,
  typeDecay = 1,
  in_parallel = FALSE,
  n_cores = detectCores() - 1,
  cluster = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rules}{a data frame with a column "condition".}

\item{data}{data to use for calculating the metrics.}

\item{target}{response variable.}

\item{classPos}{for classification tasks, the positive class predicted.}

\item{maxDecay}{threshold for the increase in error; if maxDecay = -Inf, no pruning is done; if maxDecay = 0, only variables increasing the error are pruned from decisions.}

\item{typeDecay}{if typeDecay = 1, the absolute increase in error is computed, and the relative one is computed if typeDecay = 2 (default).}

\item{in_parallel}{if TRUE, the function is run in parallel.}

\item{n_cores}{if in_parallel = TRUE, and no cluster has been passed: number of cores to use, default is detectCores() - 1.}

\item{cluster}{the cluster to use to run the function in parallel.}
}
\value{
Decision ensemble with pruned conditions.
}
\description{
This function removes from rules, variables that do not increase the rule error more than a certain threshold. See the pruneRules function from the inTrees package (Deng, 2019) for more details.
